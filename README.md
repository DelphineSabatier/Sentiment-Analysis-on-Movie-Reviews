# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Movie-Reviews
Classify the sentiment of sentences from the Rotten Tomatoes dataset

## Objective of this project
My objective is to play with the dataset and build several models with different complexity. 

## Dataset
Dataset is coming from this [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews/overview)

## Roadmap
- [ ] Unbalanced dataset -> explore the possibilities to balance it.
- [ ] Machine Learning supervised with binary target -> use train dataset as it is labelled and split into train/test for this model.
  - [X] First version done
  - [ ] Finetuning this ML supervised
- [ ] Another model : ML unsupervised or DL ?
